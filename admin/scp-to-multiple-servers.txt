Proposal

	Create a program that distributes a set of file directories to multiple servers based on saved credentials.  

Language

	Java/Groovy

Format

	GUI - Groovy Swing Builder


Outline

	Upon opening the program you will be prompted for a password.

	The opening screen will be a summary of servers and when they were last updated and from which computer.  The will have a color code for easy interpretation of what needs to be changed.

	Each server will have a list of files that are to be synced.


Important Features

	Security

		Security needs to be a big sell on this software.  Users of the software will want to know that no one else who hacks their computer can access their credentials and functionality. I will have to research the many ways of securing a connection, passwords and credentials. salting, encrypting, etc.

	Ease of use

		Easily understood prompts for managing multiple servers.
